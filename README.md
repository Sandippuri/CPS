### **ICON CPS**
ICON's Contribution Proposal System (CPS) is a decentralized governance mechanism that is governed by ICON Network Validators, built to support developers and teams wanting to contribute to the ICON blockchain.

The CPS eliminates the necessity of a central authority in grant decision making processes and provides an opportunity for ICONists to pursue new initiatives and accrue governance rights within the network.

This Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) is one of the first steps towards the migration of the ICON Network into a fully operational DAO. 

The CPS supports worthy projects through grants from the Contribution Proposal Fund (CPF), which grows through the daily accumulation of block rewards provided by ICON Network inflation.
